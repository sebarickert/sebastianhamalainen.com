## What did I do?

I wanted to build my personal website with React for a long time and after finding about GatsbyJS and its hype, I wanted to try it.


## Tech stack used in this project

I configured the site to work with porftolio showcases, blog posts and basic pages.

The website is using GatsbyJS and is using modern tooling. As well using SCSS for styling.

## What I learned

I learned more about workig with React and of course the main workhorse GatsbyJS, with GraphQL (which is really nice!).

Chopping elements into own components and trying to make component structures very simple.
