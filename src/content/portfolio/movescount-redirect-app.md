## What did I do?

I built this App for my friend, because of his request for this kind of an App and his idea, and some React training for me.

I did the design for this App and its creation with React.


## Tech stack used in this project

This App uses CRA (Create React App) but with my own template, which has SCSS with utils built-in and base styling.

## What I learned

I learned how to work with React and make it work with REST.

Learned how to calculate the next weeks monday with JavaScript, that it dynamically sets the end date.
