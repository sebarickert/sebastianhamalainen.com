## What did I do?

I used a public API to fetch data about all countries of the globe and to list them on the frontpage of this App.

Searching possibility with the name of the country, in its original language or in english.

Clicking on the Country items button will open up Google Maps with the location of the Country in question.


## Tech stack used in this project

This App uses CRA (Create React App), but with customised template, which has SCSS working with utils and base styling.

Public API fetching data about countries.


## What I learned

REST API workflow with React and to create a search that work with multiple types of inputs.
