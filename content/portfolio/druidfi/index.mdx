## What did I do?

In 2015 I entered this Drupal house as an intern and the first task given was to rebuild the whole website with the, at that time latest release candidate (Drupal 8-rc4).

In late 2016 I was on the "bench" and had nothing to do, so I figured to rebuild the website's Front-end from scratch using Flexbox.

In 2018 I had rebuild the Front-end again with new a design and more functionalities, such as sliders for references.

## Tech stack used in this project

This site was originally running on the Drupal 8 Beta version and after that on the Drupal 8-rc4 and then finally the released Drupal 8. Front-end building has tools such as Gulp for compiling our SCSS to CSS and JavaScript to ES5.

## What I learned

I learned that in a years time of starting at Druid I was already very confident with my Front-end styling skills. Learned as well how to use CSS's flexbox properly and more about Drupal in general.
