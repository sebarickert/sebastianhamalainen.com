## What did I do?

I wanted to build my personal website with React for a long time and after finding about GatsbyJS and its hype, I wanted to try it.

## Design iterations

The look has changed drastically, when you look from the first design to a more recent one. This quite nicely shows how your own design language evolves.

Mine seems to get more and more simpler and "cleaner".

I got bored of the design and was fed up with my codebases state, so I started to clean it up.

Kept some things from the old designs, but implemented some new styles for various components and listings.

## Tech stack used in this project

I configured the site to work with porftolio showcases, blog posts and basic pages.

The website is using GatsbyJS and is using modern tooling. As well using SCSS for styling.

## What I learned

I learned more about working with React and of course the main workhorse GatsbyJS, with GraphQL (which is really nice!).

Chopping elements into own components and trying to make component structures very simple.
