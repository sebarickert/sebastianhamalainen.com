## What did I do?

Website maintenance work with a team consisting of 4 people in total.

Refactored legacy CSS code to modern CSS.

Rebuilt the Frontpage with a new design and created a custom "Welcome" landing page.

Improved the websites major accessibility issues; you weren't able to use the website with keyboard only (menu and its submenu, mobile hamburger menu and search). Improved screen reader readability as well.
