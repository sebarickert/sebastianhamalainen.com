## What did I do?

My role in this project was first to just build the footer and make it sticky. After the website got released, I got to work on maintenance tasks. Updated and created some Drupal paragraphs. Small React logic tweaks.

## Tech stack used in this project

Drupal 8 with heavy use of the contrib Paragraphs -module.

Booking is built with React and integrated into Drupal.

## What I learned

How Drupal + React projects look like and how to work on them.
