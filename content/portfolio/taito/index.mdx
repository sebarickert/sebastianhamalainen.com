## What did I do?

Initialized the Drupal 8  with commerce installations custom theme and built the whole front-end. It took me just under a week to finish building.

Made sure the Drupal 8 commerce checkout session looks really nice and works properly and responsively.

Added a very nicely working slider for the product pages. It works differently depending on the amount of images listed on the product itself.

## Tech stack used in this project

Drupal 8 with commerce. Custom theme uses the basics, such as plain vanilla JavaScript and a gulp compiler for the SCSS (and of course the custom JavaScript).

Wanted to try out proper custom submit buttons, so I created custom button twig templates initializing it before in the `.theme` file. Regular drupal submit buttons are `input` elements that have `type="submit"` attributes. I wanted them to be semantic HTML buttons.

## What I learned

I learned to work with a clean commerce website and how it works differently comparing it to vanilla Drupal 8. Learned as well to create the custom button twig templates for future projects.
