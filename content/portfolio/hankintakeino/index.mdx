## What did I do?

Updated the website from an ancient Drupal 8 version to the newest stable Drupal 8 release version.

Improved usability for the customer with the Drupal 8 installation and removed unnecessary features.

Improved the websites major accessibility issues; you weren't able to use the website with keyboard only (menu and its submenu, mobile hamburger menu and search).

## Tech stack used in this project

Drupal 8. Gulp compiler for JavaScript and SCSS.

## What I learned

This was my first proper project with the task of improving accessibility issues. Learned a lot about `aria` attributes  and `tabindex` to improve keyboard usability.
