## What did I do?

I worked on this project with a Scrum-team consisting of people from different organisations. I was part of the development team with a couple of my colleagues from work.

My role primarily was to create very functional Paragraphs-module block variations for the very differing content and to make content pages styles very appealing. Accessibility played a major role, because the law mandates public sector websites to meet the mininum criteria of WCAG 2.1 level AA.

## Tech stack used in this project

This project uses the latest version of Drupal 8. It has a custom theme that uses the basics, such as plain vanilla JavaScript and a gulp compiler for the SCSS (and of course the custom JavaScript).

Heavy use of the Paragraph-module from Drupal 8 to be able to create very differing content pages.

## What I learned

I learned a lot about the Paragraph-module and how much you can actually make your custom Paragraph-blocks functional with different checkboxes and such. I was also able to get my hands a bit dirty with PHP to get more comfortable with language.
