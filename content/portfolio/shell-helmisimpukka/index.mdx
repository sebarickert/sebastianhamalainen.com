## What did I do?

I worked on this project from the ground up in a team consisting of 4-6 people.

Majority of my work was front-end related, e. g. making it responsive, compatible with browsers and do basic styling.


## Tech stack used in this project

The site is built on Drupal 8. Building the Front-end we used tools such as grunt for compiling our SCSS to CSS and JavaScript to ES5.

Drupal is built on PHP so that was the main workhorse language making use of custom modules and hooks.

## What I learned

I learned how to work in a team and with a proper customer, the BEM methology and even more about Sass, JavaScript and a little bit of PHP.
