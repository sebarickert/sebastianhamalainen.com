## What did I do?

I mainly built the Front-end aspects of the website and configured the Groups -module functionality to work with different kind of permissions and users. Also basic site building.

Started this project working alone and throughout the projects lifespan I had help from others working on it as well.

## Tech stack used in this project

The website is running on the lastest version Drupal 8. Using the contrib Groups -module for managin users groups.

Front-end building has tools such as Gulp for compiling our SCSS to CSS and JavaScript to ES5.

## What I learned

After my mandatory military service, this project was the first customer project and I re-learnt stuff and of course more of Drupal 8 and it's contrib module, Group.
