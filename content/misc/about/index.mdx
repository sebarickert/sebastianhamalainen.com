Hi, I'm Sebastian. I'm a Front-end Developer located in Helsinki, Finland. Currently working at [Druid](https://druid.fi) making the web a better place. I am very interested in clean and very usable Web Design that is also accessible.

I'm also a big JavaScript enthusiast and try to constantly better myself with the language and familiarize myself with its different frameworks.

My main love is CSS with Sass (SCSS). I have held a CSS Workshop for a group of people, where we went over the fundamentals of CSS and a basic Q&A.

Here you'll find bits and pieces of information about me, my past professional experience and education.

## Experience

- Jan 2018 to **present**, as Drupal Developer at [Druid](https://druid.fi)
- Oct 2015 to Dec 2016, as Junior Drupal Developer at [Druid](https://druid.fi) 

I have been specializing in Front-end development since 2013 and around that time my passion for development has started.

Over the years I have provided the following for clients:
- Modernizing old CSS implementations
- Refactoring parts of codebases
- Responsive Websites
- Semantic HTML and accessible websites

I have extensive knowledge of working with CMS systems and experience in large-scale web service projects. I mostly have been responsible for user interface design and accessibility.


## Education

- Aug 2018 to Jun 2020, Business Information Technology (BBA) at [Laurea University of Applied Sciences](https://www.laurea.fi/)
- Aug 2013 to Jun 2016, Vocational Qualification in Business Information Technology at [Helsinki Business College](https://www.bc.fi/)


While attending Helsinki Business College, I participated in the Taitaja -competition in 2015 and 2016, making it to the finals in 2016

### What tools do I use?

If you are interested to know what tools I use for on day to day basis, I've created a [page](/uses) where I've compiled a list of stuff and try to keep it up to date.
