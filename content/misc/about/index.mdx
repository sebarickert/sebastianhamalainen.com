Hi, I'm Sebastian. I'm a Front-end Developer located in Helsinki, Finland. Currently working at [Druid](https://druid.fi) making the web a better place. I am very interested in clean and very usable Web Design that is also accessible.

I'm also a big JavaScript enthusiast and try to constantly better myself with the language and familiarize myself with its different frameworks.

My main love is CSS with Sass (SCSS). I have held a CSS Workshop for a group of people, where we went over the fundamentals of CSS and a basic Q&A.

Here you'll find bits and pieces of information about me, my past professional experience and education.
