I'll show you how to update the `upload_file_size` and `post_max_size` in your php.ini file!

Find your `php.ini` file — `phpinfo()` will help you with this.

Now edit your php.ini (mine's located in here)

```bash
sudo vim /etc/php/7.1/apache2/php.ini
```

Find `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`

When using vim, "?" before the word will find it for you

```php
?upload_max_filesize
?post_max_size
```

I've set mine to **64M** — this will be good enough

```php
upload_max_filesize=64M
post_max_size=64M
```

After modifying your `php.ini` file, you need to restart your HTTP server to use new configuration — In my case it's apache

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

Wooohooo! You've updated `upload_file_size` and `post_max_size` in your `php.ini` file!
