I have been tasked to develop on an existing codebase which uses React and Drupal together. On the React side, it has a lot of different tests for its React components using Jest. I have never wrote any tests myself using Jest (or tests in general).

I've now investigated and read a bit on about Jest & its documentation and it seems to be very straight forward.

## React and using Drupal translations

In my React components I have several bits of dynamic or static strings that need to be able to be translated through Drupal's interface translations.

Drupal has a global `Drupal.t()` function that can be used with React. You are able to wrap your strings like this:

```jsx
const Card = () => {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2 className="card__heading">
        {`${Drupal.t('Drupal translations')}`}
      </h2>
    </div>
  )
};
```

In Drupal you should now be able to see `Drupal translations` to be translatable in the user interface translation section.

## Testing React components with Jest

Jest is really straight forward with how to test a component:

1. Create `.spec.js` file
2. Import React
3. Import your React component you want to create tests for
4. Write and create the test

That's the basic gist of it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card } from './Card';

describe('<Card />', () => {
  it('renders without error', () => {
    expect(<Card />).toBeTruthy();
  });
}
```

That's the test. Easy isn't it?

**Oh no. The tests have failed. Why you ask?**

```
ReferenceError: Drupal is not defined
```

We need to somehow define `Drupal` to Jest for the tests to pass. This is where I hit a wall with Jest tests with React and Drupal.

I didn't find anything related to this issue by googling for it, until I found the correct search query: "jest ignore drupal". I don't know why I didn't think of that earlier.

I found a post from Elendev about ["React, TypeScript, Jest and global variables"](https://medium.com/@elendev/react-typescript-jest-and-global-variables-2d128d1e9b00) which helped me get my tests to pass.

## Creating global Jest variables

I followed Elendev's post and created myself a global variable for `Drupal` and its `t()` function. This is the line you need:

```jsx
global.Drupal = { t: text => text };
```

This is the final React component structure which will pass with using `Drupal.t()` function:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card } from './Card';

describe('<Card />', () => {
  it('renders without error', () => {
    global.Drupal = { t: text => text }; // Create global variable.
    expect(<Card />).toBeTruthy();
    delete global.Drupal; // Remove the created global variable after the test.
  });
}
```

**Happy coding!**
