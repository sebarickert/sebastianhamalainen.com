import Button from '../../../src/components/button/button';

Creating a visually appealing and good looking button can be tough. I've had my fair share of bad looking buttons that I thought looked good at the time, but then I find a website doing them much better. **Rinse and repeat**.

That is why I've shared below the **current** best looking button _in my opinion, and opinions may wary a lot_.

## Syntax

When creating a button (or any component with variations), you need to first specify the default values for it.

I've noticed that the padding amount is crucial for a button to be very appealing or not. A nice transition for the hover effect makes a big difference as well and should be considered.

_Note: In these examples I'm using SCSS and not vanilla CSS._

```scss
.button {
  background-color: transparent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 0;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-flex;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  letter-spacing: .25px;
  line-height: normal;
  padding: 16px 24px;
  text-indent: .25px;
}
```

### Creating variations on top of the default button

For the variation buttons you add a flag on the element. Use them to change appearance or behavior. The flag is e.g. `--{YOUR VARIATION NAME}`.

This method comes from the [BEM methology](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

```scss
.button--primary {
  background-color: #0069ff;
  border-color: #0069ff;
  color: #ffffff;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    background-color: #0069ff;
    border-color: #0069ff;
    color: #ffffff;
  }
}

.button--secondary {
  background-color: transparent;
  border: 2px solid #0069ff;
  color: #0069ff;
  padding: 14px 24px;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    background-color: #0069ff;
    border-color: #0069ff;
    color: #ffffff;
  }
}
```

As you can see, you only change some smaller things on the variations to create a whole new button style. You can have infinite amount of variations, the only limit is your mind.

## Demo

On my personal website I have a primary button and a secondary button variation. They only differ by color.

### Default button

The default button only has very basic styles added to it and looks dull, but this is the fallback if the variations don't work for some odd reason.

The default button has no hover effect as well, they are added on the variations.

### Primary button

The primary button has a background color of blue with white text. Like this:

<Button primary noLink>
  Primary
</Button>

It also has a large variation, which has a larger font size and a bit more padding.

<Button primary large noLink>
  Primary large
</Button>

### Secondary button

The secondary button has a transparent background color and with blue text.

When hovered of focused it will fill it background with a blue color and change the text color to white. Like this:

<Button secondary noLink>
  Secondary
</Button>

It also has a large variation, which has a larger font size and a bit more padding.

<Button secondary large noLink>
  Secondary large
</Button>

## Conclusion

These buttons look very awesome and can be used anywhere. That's about it. See you in the next one.
