import Button from '../../../src/components/button/button';

Creating a visually appealing and good looking button can be tough. I've had my fair share of bad looking buttons that I thought looked good at the time, but then I find a website doing them much better. **Rinse and repeat**.

That is why I've shared below the **current** best looking button _in my opinion, and opinions may wary a lot_.

## Syntax

When creating a button (or any component with variations), you need to first specify the default values for it.

I've noticed that the padding amount is crucial for a button to be very appealing or not. A nice transition for the hover effect makes a big difference as well and should be considered.

_Note: In these examples I'm using SCSS and not vanilla CSS._

```scss
.button {
  background-color: transparent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid #000000;
  color: #000000;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  padding: 12px 32px;
  position: relative;
  text-align: center;
  transition: all .2s ease-in-out;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    cursor: pointer;
    outline: none;
  }
}
```

### Creating variations on top of the default button

For the variation buttons you add a flag on the element. Use them to change appearance or behavior. The flag is e.g. `--{YOUR VARIATION NAME}`.

This method comes from the [BEM methology](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

```scss
.button--primary {
  background-color: #e95378;
  border-color: #e95378;
  color: #ffffff;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    background-color: #ba4260;
    border-color: #ba4260;
    color: #ffffff;
  }
}

.button--secondary {
  background-color: #27d771;
  border-color: #27d771;
  color: #000000;

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    background-color: #1fac5a;
    border-color: #1fac5a;
    color: #000000;
  }
}
```

As you can see, you only change some smaller things on the variations to create a whole new button style. You can have infinite amount of variations, the only limit is your mind.

## Demo

On my personal website I have a primary button and a secondary button variation. They only differ by color.

### Default button

The default button only has very basic styles added to it and looks dull, but this is the fallback if the variations don't work for some odd reason.

<Button noLink>
  I'm the default button!
</Button>

The default button has no hover effect as well, they are added on the variations.

### Primary button

The primary button has a background color similar to pink with white text. Like this:


<Button primary noLink>
  I'm the primary button!
</Button>

### Secondary button

The secondary button has a background color of light green with black text, to be accessible of course. Like this:

<Button secondary noLink>
  I'm the secondary button variation!
</Button>

## Conclusion

These buttons look very awesome and can be used anywhere. That's about it. See you in the next one.
